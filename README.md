# Model Island - Island Sculptor & Creator 🏝️

Model Island is a fun island maker made over 30 days for a Discord challenge run by Bruno Simon. It let's you sculpt an island up out of the ocean using sculpting brush tools in your browser. When you're happy with the topography of your land, decorate it with different models such as trees, houses and turbines.

## Stack

I used this challenge as an opportunity to use both the WebGPU renderer in three.js as well as their new shading language, TSL. I love both and the future of 3D on the web is bright.

## Future Updates

When time allows, I plan to keep adding to this project. High priorities:

- UI improvements
    - Show where the brush tools intersect the terrain
    - Show visual indication of brush size and strength on change 
- Add "moods" - change the visual appearance / colouring of the scene with presets 
- Improve the appearance of terrain material
- Save & share island
- Add **lots** more models that can be placed
- ... and lots more! 😅
